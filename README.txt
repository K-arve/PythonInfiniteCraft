Yo, whatsup. Basically this is a heavily duct taped together project I made thats just infinite craft in python using gemini API.
anyways yeah just start this and you'll figure it out soon enough.
if you get an error when starting up restart once and you should be good, this is not a problem of mine, but one of gemini API.
If it crashes on confirming key, you either inputed your key wrong or you fucked up your save file, just delete the key.dat file
IF YOU ARE DELETING KEY.DAT, IT WILL RESET YOUR ELEMENTS TOO, BACK THEM UP IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM
